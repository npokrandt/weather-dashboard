# Weather dashboard

## How to use this site:

Welcome to the weather dashboard! It uses the power of the OpenWeather API to show you the current weather conditions and a 5 day forecast of any city in the world!

There are 2 sections, one on the left and one on the right. Initially the right side is a placeholder where the weather info will show up. The left side has a search bar. Type a city in and click the button beneath, and the weather shows up on the right. The top section shows the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed of the city searched, with the city name, date and visual representation of the weather above. below that section are five boxes for each of the next 5 days' weather, again showing the proposed temperature, humidity and wind speed. Once a city has been searched, it will be saved and a button with its name will appear below the form. Clicking this button will also show the current weather and 5 day forecast for that city!

Stay safe out there!
